### GitHub Repository Description  

**Repository Name:** Pick-and-Place-Simulation-RoboDK  

**Description:**  
This repository contains a RoboDK simulation project for a Pick and Place operation using the **Doosan Robotics M1013 White Robot**. The project demonstrates step-by-step configuration, programming, and execution of robotic movements to simulate object picking and placing tasks.  

### Project Overview

*Above GIF shows the coding.*

**Key Features:**  
- **Robot Configuration:** Setup and positioning of the robot and gripper.  
- **Reference Frames:** Defining multiple frames for precise positioning.  
- **Target Programming:** Teaching targets and defining trajectories for the pick-and-place sequence.  
- **Dynamic Object Handling:** Attaching and detaching objects using simulation event instructions.  
- **Program Structure:** Separate programs for resetting, picking, and placing, combined into a main sequence.  
- **Simulation Testing:** End-to-end testing and validation of the workflow.  

**Files Included:**  
- **Simulation File (.rdk):** The main RoboDK simulation file with all configurations and programs.  
- **Documentation (Markdown):** A detailed guide outlining the setup and programming process.  

**Purpose:**  
This project serves as a learning resource and template for robotic programming enthusiasts, students, and researchers looking to develop and simulate pick-and-place operations in RoboDK.  

**Usage Instructions:**  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the `.rdk` file in RoboDK.  
3. Follow the documentation to understand the simulation steps.  
4. Run the main program and observe the robot's operation.
